# Module Two Challenge Report

## Overview of the Project 
---

Steve was interested to study the stock market to recomend his parents the lowest risk stock. To perform this task a code was developed to analyze the data avaialable in excel sheet. However, the created code needs to be looked at to increase its efficiency in terms of lower running time. In this analysis the code created in the second module will be refactored to improve its performance. Refactorign is very important because most of the time the first attempt will not produce the optimum performance and going over the code and thinking of better ways to do the task is important in the programing field. 

## Results

Here in the new code, arrays was utilized to eliminate the use of inner for-loop to make the computational time faster and the code more efficient. The below screenshots illustrat the new idea implemented to perfrom the analysis of the stcoks.

After running the code, the computational time is significantly reduced from 1.26 seconds to 0.21 seconds in the case of 2018 trade year, and from 1.29 seconds to 0.22 seconds in the case of 2017 trade year. The below pictures shows the runnning in each case.
