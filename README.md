# Module Two Challenge Report

## Overview of the Project 
---

Steve was interested to study the stock market to recomend his parents the lowest risk stock. To perform this task a code was developed to analyze the data avaialable in excel sheet. However, the created code needs to be looked at to increase its efficiency in terms of lower running time. In this analysis the code created in the second module will be refactored to improve its performance. Refactorign is very important because most of the time the first attempt will not produce the optimum performance and going over the code and thinking of better ways to do the task is important in the programing field. 

## Results

Here in the new code, arrays was utilized to eliminate the use of inner for-loop to make the computational time faster and the code more efficient. The below screenshots illustrat the new idea implemented to perfrom the analysis of the stcoks.

After running the code, the computational time is significantly reduced from 1.26 seconds to 0.21 seconds in the case of 2018 trade year, and from 1.29 seconds to 0.22 seconds in the case of 2017 trade year. The below pictures shows the runnning in each case.

## Summary

Advantages of code refactoring:

- Produce a more efficient program that reduces the time consumed to perform a certain task. 
- Utilizes less resources which enables machines with lower computational capabitlities of running the program more efficiently. 

Disadvantages of code refactoring:

- It is a time consuming process which uses time that can be put on performing other task. 
- It takes lots of the company resources from staff to computational power to run and test the refatored code. 

Pros of the refactored code:

- It runs much faster than the original code. 
- it consumes less computational power compared to the original code.

Cons of the refactored code:

- It needs more experience in coding to be able to handle the arrays. 

Pros of the original code:

- it is easier to write as it is shorter and more simpler. 

Cons of the original code:

- it takes more time to run.
- it consumes more computational resources to do the desired task.
