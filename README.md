## Overview of the Project 
---

Steve was interested to study the stock market to recomend his parents the lowest risk stock. To perform this task a code was developed to analyze the data avaialable in excel sheet. However, the created code needs to be looked at to increase its efficiency in terms of lower running time. In this analysis the code created in the second module will be refactored to improve its performance. Refactorign is very important because most of the time the first attempt will not produce the optimum performance and going over the code and thinking of better ways to do the task is important in the programing field.
